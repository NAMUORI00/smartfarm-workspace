# Limitations and Ethical Considerations

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of limitations in the Wasabi QA Dataset (Korean), intended for transparency in academic and research contexts.

---

## 1. Synthetic Data Limitations

### 1.1 Absence of Human Authorship

**Issue**: All 220 QA pairs are generated by LLMs (gemini-2.5-flash, claude-sonnet-4-5) without human authorship.

**Implications**:
- Questions may not reflect real-world user information needs
- Answer patterns may be homogeneous (model-specific style)
- Edge cases and creative question formulations may be underrepresented

**Mitigation Attempted**:
- Evol-Instruct for question diversification
- Multiple complexity levels (basic/intermediate/advanced)
- ROUGE-L filtering for redundancy removal (threshold=0.7)

**Residual Risk**: Moderate - Model bias in question formulation persists.

### 1.2 No Human Verification

**Issue**: Factual accuracy of answers has not been verified by domain experts.

**Implications**:
- Agricultural advice may contain errors
- Numerical values (temperatures, concentrations) may be inaccurate
- Causal relationships may be misrepresented

**Evidence from Validation**:
- Numerical consistency: 95% (5% potential errors in numbers)
- Groundedness: 52% (48% may contain unverified claims)

**Recommendation**: Do not use as authoritative cultivation guide without expert review.

---

## 2. Translation Artifacts

### 2.1 EN→KO Translation Quality

**Issue**: Source documents were English, machine-translated to Korean.

**Implications**:
- Unnatural Korean expressions possible
- Technical terms may be inconsistently translated
- Nuance loss in complex sentences

**Translation Pipeline**:
- Model: gemini-2.5-flash
- Quality scoring: MQM framework applied

**Known Issues**:
- Some samples retain English technical terms
- Sentence structures may follow English patterns
- Korean agricultural terminology may be non-standard

### 2.2 Cultural Context

**Issue**: Western source materials may not reflect Korean agricultural practices.

**Implications**:
- Climate assumptions may not apply to Korea
- Equipment specifications may differ
- Regulatory references may be irrelevant

## 3. Groundedness and Hallucination

### 3.1 Validation Results

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Overall Groundedness | 0.52 | Moderate |
| Keyword Coverage | 0.23 | Low |
| Hallucination Suspects | 105/220 (48%) | High |
| Numerical Consistency | 0.95 | Excellent |

### 3.2 Analysis of Flagged Samples

**Common Patterns in Hallucination Suspects**:

1. **Inference Beyond Context** (most common)
   - Answer provides logical extensions not in source
   - Example: Inferring pest relationships from temperature data
   
2. **Citation Hallucination**
   - References to papers (e.g., "CHADWICK et al., 1993") without content
   - Year numbers flagged as inconsistent

3. **Heavy Paraphrasing** (false positives)
   - Valid answers with different vocabulary
   - Keyword matching fails despite semantic equivalence

### 3.3 Interpretation Caution

The 48% hallucination rate includes:
- **True Positives**: Answers containing fabricated information
- **False Positives**: Valid paraphrasing misidentified by keyword matching

Actual hallucination rate is likely **30-40%** after false positive adjustment.

## 4. Evaluation Methodology Limitations

### 4.1 No Human Evaluation

**Issue**: All quality metrics are automated.

**Limitations**:
- Cannot assess answer usefulness to real users
- Cannot evaluate cultural/linguistic naturalness
- Cannot verify factual correctness beyond keyword matching

**Attempted Mitigations**:
- Multiple automated metrics (ROUGE-L, keyword coverage, numerical consistency)
- LLM-as-a-Judge for quality scoring
- Prometheus-style rubric evaluation

### 4.2 Metric Limitations

| Metric | Limitation |
|--------|------------|
| ROUGE-L | Penalizes valid paraphrasing |
| Keyword Coverage | Fails on synonym usage |
| Numerical Consistency | Only catches explicit numbers |
| LLM Judge | Inherits model biases |

### 4.3 No Inter-Annotator Agreement

Human evaluation with multiple annotators was not conducted, preventing:
- Cohen's Kappa calculation
- Reliability assessment
- Subjective quality validation

---

## 5. Domain and Scope Limitations

### 5.1 Single Crop Focus

**Issue**: Dataset covers only wasabi (Eutrema japonicum).

**Implications**:
- Models trained on this data may not generalize to other crops
- Wasabi-specific terminology dominates vocabulary
- Limited utility for general smart farm applications

### 5.2 Category Imbalance

| Category | Count | % |
|----------|-------|---|
| 재배기술 | 48 | 21.8% |
| 양액관리 | 48 | 21.8% |
| 설비장비 | 38 | 17.3% |
| 병해충 | 34 | 15.5% |
| 수확품질 | 30 | 13.6% |
| 환경조건 | 22 | 10.0% |

Environment conditions (환경조건) underrepresented despite importance.

### 5.3 Complexity Distribution

Advanced questions (25.5%) may be underrepresented for expert-level applications.

---

## 6. Technical Limitations

### 6.1 Reproducibility Concerns

**Positive**:
- Random seed fixed (seed=42)
- Prompt templates saved (prompts/*.jinja)
- Configuration versioned (config/settings.yaml)

**Limitations**:
- LLM API responses may vary over time (model updates)
- Temperature > 0 introduces non-determinism
- Exact reproduction requires API version locking

### 6.2 Source Document Availability

Original web documents may:
- Change content over time
- Become unavailable (link rot)
- Be subject to copyright restrictions

---

## 7. Ethical Considerations

### 7.1 Potential Misuse

**Risk**: Agricultural advice based on unverified LLM outputs.

**Scenarios**:
- User follows incorrect temperature/humidity guidance
- Improper chemical/fertilizer dosing from dataset
- Economic loss from cultivation failures

**Mitigation**: Clear disclaimer in DATASET_CARD.md and documentation.

### 7.2 Model Bias Propagation

Dataset may perpetuate:
- Western-centric agricultural practices
- Gender/cultural biases in source materials
- Commercial biases from specific product references

### 7.3 Environmental Impact

LLM usage for dataset generation:
- Estimated: ~50,000 tokens input + 100,000 tokens output
- Carbon footprint: Small but non-zero
- No offsetting performed

## 8. Recommendations for Users

### 8.1 Appropriate Uses

| Use Case | Appropriateness | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| RAG fine-tuning research | ✅ Appropriate | Primary intended use |
| Question generation baseline | ✅ Appropriate | Demonstrates methodology |
| Korean NLP evaluation | ✅ Appropriate | Domain-specific benchmark |
| Production cultivation guide | ⚠️ Caution | Requires expert validation |
| Sole training data | ⚠️ Caution | Combine with other sources |

### 8.2 Mitigation Strategies

For researchers using this dataset:

1. **Supplement with human-curated data** (at least 10-20%)
2. **Validate critical information** with domain experts
3. **Apply additional filtering** based on use case
4. **Report limitations** when publishing results

### 8.3 Not Recommended

- Using as authoritative agricultural reference
- Deploying directly without human review
- Assuming numerical values are verified
- Generalizing to non-wasabi crops

---

## 9. Future Work

Addressing limitations in future versions:

1. **Human Evaluation**: Recruit agricultural experts for validation
2. **Additional Crops**: Expand to pepper, tomato, lettuce
3. **Korean-Native Sources**: Include Korean agricultural extension materials
4. **Improved Metrics**: Implement semantic similarity-based groundedness
5. **Interactive Validation**: Develop annotation interface for quality review

## Citation

When reporting limitations in academic work:

> The Wasabi QA Dataset contains 220 synthetic QA pairs generated without human verification. Automated validation indicates 48% of samples may contain information not directly grounded in source context, though this includes false positives from paraphrasing. Users should validate critical information with domain experts.
