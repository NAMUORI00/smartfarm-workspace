# tables/

Structured performance tables and comparison matrices supporting the research paper's experimental sections.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Table index and descriptions |
| `table1_baseline.md` | Baseline comparison against standard RAG systems |
| `table2_ablation.md` | Ablation study results for hybrid retrieval components |
| `table3_edge.md` | Edge device performance metrics (latency, memory, throughput) |
| `table5_ragas.md` | RAGAS evaluation metrics (faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision) |

## For AI Agents

- These files contain quantitative results and performance metrics
- Tables support claims made in paper sections 05_experiments.md
- NEVER modify table files without explicit user request
- Reference specific tables when discussing performance improvements
- Use for validation of system design decisions and optimization effectiveness
