# era-smartfarm-rag/validation/

Validation reports and benchmark analysis documents verifying system performance, correctness, and optimization effectiveness in edge environments.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ERA_RAG_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` | Comprehensive edge environment validation (architecture analysis, performance metrics, 7/7 tests passed) |
| `BENCHMARK_COMPARISON_LOG.md` | Detailed benchmark test logs and baseline comparisons |
| `HYBRID_RETRIEVAL_ROOT_CAUSE_REPORT.md` | Performance analysis and optimization recommendations for hybrid retrieval component |

## For AI Agents

- These files document system validation and performance verification
- Contains empirical evidence for claims made in experiments section (05_experiments.md)
- NEVER modify validation reports without explicit user request
- Reference for understanding performance bottlenecks and optimization strategies
- Use to verify design decisions against actual measured results
- Read for troubleshooting guidance and operational insights
