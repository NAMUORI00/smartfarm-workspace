A detailed technical architecture diagram of 'ERA-SmartFarm-RAG'. Layout flows from left to right. 
Left section 'Data Ingestion (Offline)': Raw documents (PDFs, Logs) passing through OCR and Semantic Chunking into a Knowledge Base containing FAISS, TF-IDF, and Causal Graph.
Middle section 'Dual-Path Processing (Runtime)': A User Query flows into a 3-channel Hybrid Search (Dense+Sparse+Graph), then to Context Shaping (Crop Filter, Deduplication).
Right section 'Edge Inference': 4-bit Quantized LLM generating text, followed by a Verification module (Source Attribution, Range Check), producing a Final Answer.
Visual style: Clean, modern, professional infographic. 
Include icons for smart farm sensors and wasabi crops. 
Prominently display text '8GB RAM / Offline Environment' at the bottom.
IMPORTANT: Draw a color palette showing the main colors used in the diagram at the bottom right corner.
