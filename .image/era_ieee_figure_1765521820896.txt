A formal IEEE-style system architecture diagram for the 'Edge-RAG-Anything (ERA)' framework. Style: Technical schematic block diagram. Professional, high-contrast, clean lines. Grayscale with minimal professional blue accents. No cartoons or 3D effects. Flat, 2D vector graphic style suitable for a research paper. Layout & Components (Left to Right Flow): 1. Input Node: A simple rectangle labeled 'User Query'. 2. System Boundary: A large dashed-line box enclosing the core components, labeled 'Edge Device Environment (8GB RAM)'. 3. Core Modules (Inside Boundary): Query Processor (Rectangle), Hybrid Retrieval Module (Grouping box with 3 parallel blocks: Dense Retrieval, Sparse Retrieval, PathRAG), Fusion Layer (Block labeled 'Dynamic Weighting & Fusion'), Reranking (Decision diamond/block 'Adaptive Reranker'), Generator (Block 'Quantized LLM (Qwen3-4B)'). 4. Output Node: Rectangle labeled 'Generated Answer'. Details: Solid black arrows showing data flow. Font: Times New Roman or Arial. Background: Pure White.
