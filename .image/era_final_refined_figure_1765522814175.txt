A clean, content-rich technical diagram of the 'Edge-RAG-Anything (ERA)' architecture. Style: Professional Academic Infographic. Minimalist 2D/Flat style with very subtle depth (no heavy 3D). White background. Color Palette: Slate Blue (Core), Sage Green (Domain/PathRAG), Amber (Logic/Reranking). Layout: 1. System Boundary: A clear, thin-lined rectangle labeled 'Edge Device (Max 8GB RAM)'. 2. Process Flow (Left to Right): Input: 'User Query' -> 'Query Analysis' (Extracting Tags: [Env], [Crop]). Hybrid Retrieval (The Core): Three parallel swimlanes: Top: 'Dense Retrieval' (Icon: Embedding Vector). Mid: 'Sparse Retrieval' (Icon: Keyword Match). Bot: 'PathRAG' (Icon: Knowledge Graph Nodes). Fusion: All 3 arrows merge into a block labeled 'Dynamic Weighting' (Icon: Sliders adjusting based on tags). Adaptive Reranking: A decision diamond labeled 'Resource Check'. Path A (High RAM): 'Cross-Encoder' (High Accuracy). Path B (Low RAM): 'LLM Judge' (Efficiency). Generation: Block labeled 'Qwen3-4B (Int4)' generating the answer. 3. Output: 'Final Answer'. Constraint: No decorative background elements. Focus purely on the logical flow and component labels.
