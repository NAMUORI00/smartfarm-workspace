A comprehensive, high-density 'Informatic' system architecture diagram for 'Edge-RAG-Anything (ERA)' in Smart Wasabi Farming. Style: High-Tech Informatic: A blend of professional infographic and technical schematic. Clean, isometric or flat 2.5D design. High information density but organized. Color palette: Deep Tech Blue (System), Wasabi Green (Domain), Alert Red (Constraints). Layout & Composition: 1. Background Context: Subtle digital greenhouse grid. 2. Main Container: A central, futuristic device frame labeled 'Edge AI Unit (Max 8GB RAM)' with a RAM usage gauge showing 'Optimized Usage'. 3. Internal Pipeline: Input 'User Query'. Stage 1: Ontology Mapping (Brain icon connecting to 'Wasabi Knowledge Graph' nodes: Env, Crop, Disease). Stage 2: Hybrid Retrieval (3 distinct gears/streams merging: Dense Vector, Sparse Keyword, PathRAG). Stage 3: Dynamic Fusion (Mixing console icon adjusting sliders). Stage 4: Adaptive Reranking (Smart gate labeled 'Resource Check' diverting to 'Lightweight Judge' vs 'Heavy Reranker'). Stage 5: Generation (Processor chip labeled 'Qwen3-4B (Int4)'). 4. Output: Clear card displaying 'Optimal Temp: 13-17°C'. Title: 'ERA: Edge-RAG-Anything Architecture'.
